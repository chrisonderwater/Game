Game description & tips:
------------------------

You can play one or two players game; the game proceeds on different
levels: you must collect a given number of certain bonuses and destroy
a given percentage of the existing structures, strategically placing bombs of 
different power, in order to complete each level. These objectives are
shown in the central window under the playing screens.
But this isn't easy: you must be very careful when placing bombs!
'cause you could end up buried under boulders or destroy the objective-bonuses
too, thus being forced to give up that level! Moreover, many mutant monster
will chase you, draining off your energy.
When your energy drops to zero you will loose a life, then you can
choose to reenter the level (by pressing fire) or to restart that level
from the beginning, waiting a few seconds.
Anyway, you can't reenter a level if there aren't enough objective-bonuses
to complete it.
For every monster you destroy, you can earn one of the following
special-bonuses:


 -Present              :      2000 points.
 -Hot dog              :      1500 points + 1/3 of your energy.
 -First Aid            :      1000 points + all your energy.   
 -Yellow bomb box      :      3000 points + normal set of bombs.  
 -Green bomb box       :      1000 points + super set of bombs.
 -Jolly cloud          :      2000 points + bonus rain.
 -Digger box           :      1000 points + digger robots.  
 -Big diamond          :      5000 points.

Six types of bombs are available. Note that the most powerful one 
(and the most dangerous for your health too) is not available when you 
start a game, but you can gain it grabbing a green bomb box.
"micro-bombs" are useful for killing monsters without destroying anything
else, but they're quite weak.
"Tele-bombs" can be placed (max.5) and will not explode until you use your
remote-control (you can find it amongst your weapons, after you have placed 
some tele-bomb).
Digger robots will help you to clear the way, by eating all the small rocks
they find.
the "down" key, lets you climb down platforms and activate telepods, jumpers
and other items.
With f9 and f10 keys you can diplay a map real-time showing the situation,
the explosions, etc.

Deathmatch mode:
----------------

This option will start a two player game in a level designed for playing one
against the other. These are some differences from "normal" play:

- If one of the two characters dies, the other gains 50000 points. (So the
  fastest way to raise your score is to destroy the other).
- Falling from high places hurts your character.
- Every bonus you take gives you a little energy.
- When the "percentage of destruction" becomes too high, the level restarts.
- Deathmatch ends when a player looses all his lives (Of course).
- Highest score wins.

Problems:
---------

This program has been intended to work in dos environment, but it should
work correctly under different operative systems (I hope :)).
If this is not the case, just run it in dos mode...
If digital sound seems not to work, check if an expanded-memory manager is
present when you run the game (it should), and check port, irq, dma values 
in the configuration program.


Game speed:
-----------

The program will automatically adapt itself to your system's speed, 
(within a few seconds) but if your computer is too slow, 
you can gain speed by:

- Disabling background scenery (press f1 or f3).
- Or decreasing the playing field width. (keys f6, f7).
  (you can set this width only during one-player game).

Of course, installing the game to the hard disk will speed up every i/o 
operation.
