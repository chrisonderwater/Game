Game description & tips:
------------------------

You can play one or two players game; the game proceeds on different
levels: you must collect a given number of certain bonuses and destroy
a given percentage of the existing structures, strategically placing bombs of 
different power, in order to complete each level. These objectives are
shown in the central window under the playing screens.
But this isn't easy: you must be very careful when placing bombs!
'cause you could end up buried under boulders or destroy the objective-bonuses
too, thus being forced to give up that level! Moreover, many mutant monster
will chase you, draining off your energy.
When your energy drops to zero you will loose a life, then you can
choose to reenter the level (by pressing fire) or to restart that level
from the beginning, waiting a few seconds.
Anyway, you can't reenter a level if there aren't enough objective-bonuses
to complete it.
For every monster you destroy, you can earn one of the following
special-bonuses:


 -Present              :      2000 points.
 -Hot dog              :      1500 points + 1/3 of your energy.
 -First Aid            :      1000 points + all your energy.   
 -Yellow bomb box      :      3000 points + normal set of bombs.  
 -Green bomb box       :      1000 points + super set of bombs.
 -Jolly cloud          :      2000 points + bonus rain.
 -Big diamond          :      5000 points.

Four types of bombs are available. Note that the most powerful one 
(and the most dangerous for your health too) is not available when you 
start a game, but you can gain it grabbing a green bomb box.

Game speed:
-----------

The program will automatically adapt itself to your system's speed, 
(within a few seconds) but if your computer is too slow, 
you can gain speed by:

- Disabling background scenery (press 's').
- Or decreasing the playing field width. (keys 'e', 'r').
  (you can set this width only during one-player game).

Of course, installing the game to the hard disk will speed up every i/o 
operation.
